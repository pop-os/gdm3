gdm3 (41.3-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  In Debian 11, gdm3 provided a desktop session named "System X11 Default",
  which would attempt to choose a desktop session implementation from
  among many options:

  - the user-specific executable or shell script ~/.xsession or ~/.Xsession
  - the system-wide default for the x-session-manager alternative
  - the system-wide default for the x-window-manager alternative,
    even if it is only a window manager and not a complete desktop
    environment
  - as a last resort, the system-wide default for the x-terminal-emulator
    alternative

  This option's name was confusing, because it was difficult to predict
  which desktop environment would result from choosing it, and it has
  not been the default choice since Debian 10. It is no longer provided.

  Users of ~/.xsession, ~/.Xsession, or a session manager or window manager
  that is not already listed as an option should configure a custom session
  definition that will run it, for example by copying
  /usr/share/doc/gdm3/examples/custom-x11-session.desktop into
  /etc/X11/sessions and editing it as desired. Please see the example file
  or run  yelp help:system-admin-guide/session-custom
  to read the documentation provided by the gnome-user-docs package.
