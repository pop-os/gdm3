    - display: Exit with failure if loading existing users fails
      (GHSL-2020-202, CVE-2020-16125)
  * Xsession: Use run-parts --list instead of reimplementing it.
    Taken from x11-common.

  [ Dmitry Borodaenko ]
  * Implement has_option in Xsession.
    Now that x11-common moved this function from 20x11-common_process-args
    to Xsession (see #920778), gdm's version of Xsession also has to
    implement it. (Closes: #972108)

gdm3 (3.38.1-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/gdm3.preinst: Add script to replace possibly wrong .conf file.
    In gdm3 versions of the 3.38 series a regression was introduced causing
    the /usr/libexec/gdm-disable-wayland tool to write its supposedly
    temporary gdm file to the persistent location.
    This is particularly harmful for users of the NVIDIA drivers as they
    will get their default config file (/etc/gdm3/daemon.conf in debian and
    /etc/gdm3/custom.conf in Ubuntu) modified for good, making impossible to
    login in a Wayland session (once nvidia driver is disabled).
    As per this, in case of upgrades or install with configuration files
    left, we replace the gdm's daemon.conf/custom.conf file in case it
    matches the one that the disable-wayland tool would produce.

  * Team upload
  * d/rules: Set runtime configuration path.
    In Autotools, the default runtime configuration path used to be
    ${GDM_RUN_DIR}/custom.conf, but in the Meson build system the fallback
    changed to be the same as the custom.conf path in /etc (set to
    /etc/gdm3/daemon.conf in Debian for historical reasons).
    Explicitly set it to the path we used before switching to Meson, so
    that configuration changes by gdm-disable-wayland are temporary as
    intended, and do not persist to a subsequent boot.

  * d/greeter.dconf-defaults: Use 64px instead of 128px logo.
    Until gnome-shell 3.36.1, the logo was scaled down to be 48px tall.
    Since 3.36.1, it's shown at actual size, and 128px looks silly.

    since both the CPU and IO load are negligible.

  * Don't try to manipulate files in debian/gdm3/ when building for

gdm3 (3.30.2-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload
  * d/gbp.conf: Use debian/unstable, upstream/3.30.x branches
  * Skip building the gdm3 binary package on s390x.
    GDM requires GNOME Shell, which provides its GUI, but GNOME Shell
    is unavailable on s390x.
    Our previous attempt to avoid building an uninstallable gdm3 package
    on s390x involved a spurious build-dependency on gjs, but mozjs60 and
    gjs now work well enough on s390x to pass most of their own tests.
    However, GNOME Shell still fails tests on s390x, and in any case is
    not appropriate for mainframe-class machines that do not normally have
    a GPU or a local display.
    Continuing to build libgdm binaries for s390x, as opposed to forcing the
    entire source package to FTBFS on s390x, means we can continue to build
    gnome-panel without special hacks, allowing s390x users to install the
    GNOME 2-based GNOME Flashback environment if they particularly want a
    GNOME-based desktop on their mainframes. (Closes: #935699)
  * d/control.in: Add versioned Recommends on desktop-base (>= 10.0.0)
    In a previous version this was added to d/control, but d/control is
    regenerated from d/control.in during clean.
  * Remove spurious gjs build-dependency.
    This is less help than we had anticipated in making gdm3 unavailable on
    architectures where gnome-shell is unavailable, because gjs mostly works
    on s390x but gnome-shell does not. It is also desirable to build libgdm
    on even the architectures that do not have a working gdm, so that they
    can use gnome-panel and hence gnome-flashback.

  * Install files in /usr/share/dconf
  * Depend on dconf 0.20 for file-db support.
  * 92_gsettings_path.patch: removed. Dconf now supports database files

    /var/lib/gdm3 instead of the one in $DATADIR.
  * Don’t install the pre-generated dconf database.
  * Install the source dconf databases to their former place in

  * Simplify the dconf regeneration in gdm3.init thanks to that.
  * Move configuration generation to a separate script.
  * Use dh_systemd.
  * 92_systemd_unit.patch: port our init script specifics to the unit
    file.
  * Install the unit file.

  * Fix the logic to update the default display manager after running
    debconf.
  * Require a policykit-1 with systemd support.

  [ Laurent Bigonville ]
  * debian/gdm-launch-environment.pam: Drop the symlink to gdm3-autologin and
    install a real pam service. The differences with gdm3-autologin service
    are that gdm-launch-environment should not transition out of the xdm_t
    SELinux domain and not set a loginuid (as it's daemon's internal and not
    a real user)
  * Drop debian/patches/10_gdm3_pam.patch and rename all the pam services back
    to their upstream names. Also bump gnome-shell dependency as it uses gdm
    PAM services and the names must be synchronized.
  * debian/gdm3.init: Fix inconsistency regarding the usage of PIDFILE
    variable, thanks to Leo Antunes <costela@debian.org> (Closes: #729489)
  * debian/control.in: Depend on libpam-systemd on linux architectures as we

  * Build-depend on dconf-cli 0.19.90
    - "dconf compile ..." used during build.
  * debian/rules: drop moving gdm dconf profile out of /etc
    - upstream gdm has been fixed to not misuse dconf anymore.
  * Update debian/libgdm1.symbols
    - 4 symbols dropped related to language selection, upstream
      commit 0b2d22f63b3e6b31 says:

  * 30_utf8_locale.patch: dropped, it’s useless now. Furthermore the

  * Build-depend on gnome-settings-daemon-dev and

  * 14_pam_dialog.patch: disabled for the moment.
  * 18_switch_kill_greeter.patch: add the forced -novtswitch argument
    for Linux here, making the patch self-consistent.
  * 19_configure_xserver.patch: disabled. It lets people do stupid
    things, and upstream would prefer to have only the X server binary
    configurable.
  * Stop setting X_CONFIG_OPTIONS according to those two changes.
  * 20_endsession_respawn.patch: disable the nested stuff for now.
  * 21_schemas_usr.patch: most of it has been merged upstream. Only keep

    time.
  * gdm3.preinst: dropped, the change is in stable.
  * Require gnome-session 3.0.
  * Stop adding /usr/share/gdm to XDG_DATA_DIRS
  * Break gnome-control-center < 3 since it is required for account
    configuration.
  * 01_language.patch: new patch. Don’t set LANG, which can be already

  * 20_endsession_respawn.patch:
    + Correctly reinitialize the variable that tells a display must
      respawn. It badly broke when trying to use an already used
      display to switch to another one. Closes: #600706.
    + Also prevent respawning for static displays, otherwise the same
      problem will also happen on :0. The only remaining difference
      remaining between static and transient displays is autologin
      handling.
    + Don’t restart the static display when it exits, that would make

    as addresses.
    Add to that a stripping of ::ffff: from IPv4 mapped addresses, since
    this is not understood in $DISPLAY.
    Closes: #579033.
  * 11_no_xhost_thanks.patch: new patch. Drops the very suspicious xhost
    authentication that is set in the login window. In addition to
    questioning the security, it interacts badly with the Xephyr patch.
  * 11_xephyr_nested.patch: re-enabled.
    + Updated to apply cleanly.
    + Modified to not affect the logic of 19_configure_xserver.patch.
    + Handle the upgrade situation, where the IsNested method does not
      exist on the daemon yet.
    + Don’t pass a vtX argument to nested servers.
    + Start the nested server with an authorization that is accessible
      to the user that launches it. Add another authorization for
      Debian-gdm later. The implication is that the parent user has
      access to the nested display. Which is, well, completely
      unimportant since it already owns the server process.
    + Set GDM_PARENT_{DISPLAY,XAUTHORITY} so that the keymap is set in
      the nested display as well.
    + Put back in place the code that keeps a connection open to the X
      server, it is necessary for proper setting of the keyboard map.
    + Rework the xkb setting in the Init script. Passing model/layout/
      variant/options seems to work better than keymap/types/compat/…
    + Pass GDM_PARENT_DISPLAY to the greeter session too.
    + In the greeter panel, display only a "Quit" element when
      GDM_PARENT_DISPLAY is set. Call the session manager to force a
      logout when pressed.
  * debian/po-up/*.po:
    + Add translations for the Quit and Disconnect strings from gdm

  * 20_endsession_respawn.patch: new patch. Respawn transient displays
